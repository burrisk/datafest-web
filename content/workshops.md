A gentle introduction to R and the Tidyverse using RStudio.  This two-hour, hands-on session introduces data wrangling, data types, variable assignments, and packages. Our focus will be the Tidyverse, specifically the dplyr and ggvis packages. Tidyverse, is an approachable set of consistent data science tools enabling the R statistical programming language.

Data science skills are increasingly important for research and industry projects.  With complex data science projects, however, come complex needs for understanding and communicating analysis processes and results.  Ultimately, an analyst's data science toolbox is incomplete without visualization skills.  Incorporating effective visualizations directly into the analysis tool you are using can facilitate quick data exploration, streamline your research process, and improve the reproducibility of your research.

In this workshop we will focus on ggplot2, a library for R that creates clear and well-designed visualizations and that plays well with other tidyverse packages.

Tableau Public (available for both Windows and Mac) is free software that allows individuals to quickly and easily explore their data with a wide variety of visual representations, as well as create interactive web-based visualization dashboards. This workshop will focus on using Tableau Public to create data visualizations, starting with an overview of how the program thinks about data, common data manipulation and loading, and the terminology used. Activities will include a sample data visualization and mapping project, which will give people hands-on experience using Tableauâ€™s basic chart types and dashboard creation tools. We will also discuss publishing to the Tableau Public web server and related services and tools, like the full Tableau Desktop application (free for full-time students).
