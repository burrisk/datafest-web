A gentle introduction to the basics of R using RStudio. Learn about managing your R projects, wrangling data, and writing clear code using the Tidyverse collection of R packages. If time allows: students will also gain brief introductions to visualization with ggvis and mapping with leaflet. Attendees will have the opportunity of supplementing the materials covered in this workshop with free academic access to the interactive training at DataCamp.com. Please note that laptops with Rstudio pre-installed are required for this workshop.

In this workshop we will focus on ggplot2, a library for R that creates clear and well-designed visualizations and that plays well with other tidyverse packages. While prior experience with ggplot2 and with other tidyverse packages is not required, some basic familiarity with R is expected.  Please consider attending (or viewing a recording of) our Introduction to R workshop before attending this workshop on ggplot2. In this workshop, we will use RStudio and RMarkdown files for all exercises. Laptops are required. Please make sure you come with RStudio and the tidyverse package installed.  You may also want to install the knitr package to be able to compile the entire Rmarkdown file.

Tableau Public (available for both Windows and Mac) is free software that allows individuals to quickly and easily explore their data with a wide variety of visual representations, as well as create interactive web-based visualization dashboards. This workshop will focus on using Tableau Public to create data visualizations, starting with an overview of how the program thinks about data, common data manipulation and loading, and the terminology used. Activities will include a sample data visualization and mapping project, which will give people hands-on experience using Tableauâ€™s basic chart types and dashboard creation tools. We will also discuss publishing to the Tableau Public web server and related services and tools, like the full Tableau Desktop application (free for full-time students). Laptops with tableau public pre-installed are required for this workshop.

The last few years, we have seen an explosion in data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. The rise of cloud computing has been a major factor in this explosion. Cloud platforms, such as Microsoft Azure, enable users to quickly spin up clusters of computers to perform the high-performance calculations required by data science problems. Azure offers a number of tools for building data science solutions: From a drag and drop interface to Jupyter Notebooks as a service to a Virtual Machine pre-configured with powerful Machine Learning tools. In this session, you will learn how the cloud has impacted data science, the most useful tools in Azure for a data scientist, and when it is appropriate to use each tool.
